pyWaifu is a desktop application built with python which combines web scraping and API calls to find and download images of specific characters depending on the parameters set by the user and [MyAnimeList's](https://myanimelist.net/) database.
It stores the images on the user's computer but also shows them on its GUI built with PyQt6.

## Features

- Search and download images for waifus from a user's entire list
- Search and download images for waifus from a specifc anime
- Search and download images for a specific waifu
- 3 different modes, single, all and local
  * Single: downloads the first waifu found for any given anime
  * All: downloads all waifus found for any given anime
  * Local: shows what's currently stored in the user's computer
- Supports 6 different sources
  * Anime Pictures net
  * Safebooru
  * Danbooru
  * Gelbooru
  * Rule34 xxx
  * DeviantArt

## Usage

- Input just the name of a myanimelist user, anime id or character id in their respective fields and click "Find waifus" to begin the process.
- Click on the "Waifus" button to show everything the application has ever downloaded.
- Click on "Options" to modify the application's behavior.
- The actual name of an anime or character can be used to perform a search if the application's behavior is set to local images and some already exist for that search query.
